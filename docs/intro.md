# Welcome to *geo3D*. 

*geo3D* is a free and open-source tool for creating 3D City Models, to enhance Geography and Sustainable Development Education.

With execution via Jupyter Notebook, *geo3D* provides an accessible and reproducible workflow, that *gives* students, educators and community organizations the ability to generate topologically correct Level-of-Detail 1 (LoD1) 3D models of their own  neighbourhoods, from an open geospatial data source; namely OpenStreetMap {cite}`osm2024`.

A LoD1 3D City Model of a peri-urban village; [Mamre](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2198487).
```

The purpose of this book is illustrate, in a workshop *(tutorial-type)* format, how to create a LoD1 3D City Model, at a local level, and use these as learning tools to estimate a current population, predict a future population and estimate a Building Value Per Capita {cite}`ghosh2020` metric, of participants own communities.

A brief primer on *geo3D*, the workshop setup and content are accessible via the left menu of this webpage.
