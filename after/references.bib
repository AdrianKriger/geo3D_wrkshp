	abstract={<p>Building Volume Per Capita (BVPC - cubic meters of building per person) is presented as a proxy measure of economic inequality and a direct measure of housing inequality. Sustainable development goal 10 (SDG 10: reduced inequalities) is synergic for achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. Access to safe and affordable housing, transport systems, and public spaces are some of the targets of SDG 11 that mostly link with reducing inequalities. The Habitat III New Urban Agenda sets equal access to urban spaces, infrastructures and basic services as crucial for developing sustainable cities. Earth Observation (EO) data including remotely sensed satellite data, airborne data, and model outputs, in combination with demographic, and other statistical data, have been gaining importance for monitoring progress of the SDGs. High spatial resolution building footprint data derived from aerial photographs, stereo imagery, and LIDAR data, obtained for the cities of California, between 2010 and 2015, were used in this study. These measures of building volume were rasterized and juxtaposed with (divided by) a variety of demographic data including vector-based census data of 2015 and LandScan raster data of population counts of 2015. The National Landcover dataset of 2011 was used to characterize the land cover variability of the cities. Using these datasets, the spatial pattern and distribution of BVPC for nine cities in California were studied. The results showed that BVPC was inversely related with intensity of development, and positively related with median household income within cities. A BV-GINI was also developed to characterize the variability of the BVPC at the census tract level and the pixel level. This measure of income inequality, housing and population density is objective and easily executable. It can be used in other cities and countries and may help overcome lack of data in SDG indicators.</p>}

   abstract = {Project Jupyter is an open-source project for interactive computing widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},
